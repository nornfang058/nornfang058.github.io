        <h4>The Israeli Merkava is a main battle tank developed during the Cold War, with the IDF using modernized variants of the original Merkava to this day.</h4>

        <h3>History and background</h3>
        <p>At the end of the 1960s, the IDF had adopted a large amount of the British Centurion MBTs. The IDF considered the Centurion to be a very reliable and well-developed tank, and developed many indigenous upgrades for the Centurion, which was renamed as the "Sho't" in Israeli service.</p>
        <p>However, the IDF was looking for an indigenous replacement for the Centurion that offered better protection. Lessons learned from the 1973 Yom Kippur war showed that the Sho't and the M48/M60 MBTs ("Magach" in Israeli service) were vulnerable to contemporary Soviet AFVs that other nations around Israel fielded. Statistics also showed that there was a high hit-to-loss ratio for the crew, showing that the Sho't and the Magach had a rather lacklustre crew survivability. 
        <p>This was unacceptable, due to Israel having a limited amount of personnel in the IDF and IAI, which meant that crew protection had to be prioritized to avoid hard-to-replace losses. Training new crew also was costly, both in money and in time as well.</p>

        <h3>The First Merkavas</h3>
        <p>The Merkava was developed with a rather unconventional design compared to other contemporary MBTs, like the M60 and the T-55. The Merkava's engine and transmission was positioned in the front, with a rear-mounted turret. </p>
        <p>One would think that a tank that made crew survivability as one of the principal requirements would have composite armor. The first Merkava (MK.1) did not use composite, instead relying on traditional steel. To compensate for the reduced protection, spaced armor, sloped armored plates, a narrow turret, and spacious crew placement helped to decrease the chances of rounds penetrating and crew being injured/killed. The frontally mounted engine, transmission, and fuel tanks also helped to reduce the damage from APDS/APFSDS and HEAT rounds that penetrated the frontal armor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Merkava also had a unique feature that was not seen on other MBTs at the time: a rear door and crew compartment. This was a feature that was not seen on other MBTs due to other tanks traditionally having their engines and transmission mounted in the rear of the tank.</p>
        <p>On tanks other than the Merkava, the crew typically had to exit the tank through the turret or the hatches on the hull. The rear door allowed for the crew to quickly exit the tank in the event of a penetraation or when there was a fire. The empty space in the rear of the Merkava also could be used to transport crew or to fit stretchers.</p>

        <h3>Merkava Variants</h3>
        <p>The numerous variants of the Merkava MBT are split up into 4 main generations, the early <b>MK.1</b>, the <b>MK.2</b>, the <b>MK.3</b>, and finally the modern <b>MK.4</b>. One could consider the MK.2 to be the first "actual" variant of the Merkava since the MK.1 was more of a rushed prototype rather than an actual variant meant for use.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the Israeli Namer APC/IFV is based off of the Merkava 4 chassis, inheriting the extremely heavy armor present on all variants of the MK.4.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: The term <b>"Merkava"</b> in Hebrew means "Chariot", which is the IDF's official designation for the Merkava MBT. The term <b>"Namer"</b> in Hebrew translates to "Leopard", and is a combination of the words "<b>Na</b>gmash" and "<b>Mer</b>kava", with the Nagmash being another Israeli APC.</p>
